# Beagleash
Development of an opensource (PLC) controller voor the Beaglebone Black. This project is developed to facilitate real-time operations while using higher programming languages, such as C++. It makes use from the PRU (Programmable Realtime Unit) to ensure a deterministic execution flow.
This combination will allow for control of industrial hardware with neural networks and other mathematical constructs.
